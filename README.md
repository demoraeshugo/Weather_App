I recently learned and fell in love with AWS Amplify, the current state of my project can be seen by clicking the link above

Done:
  - Integrated a live workflow using AWS Amplify
    - NOTE: The AWS version is not fetching API data currently (Dev version is)
    - REASON: API Key has not been added, further research required on my end regarding this subject 

To Do:
  - More CSS work is required
  - Current CSS is static
  - Goal is to have responsive design that matches the mobile wireframe (below)
